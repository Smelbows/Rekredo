## What is Rekredo:

---

Rekredo is a web application that gives individuals the possibility to rent out their belongings to production companies that are looking to use specific props for their next production.
By helping to bridge the gap between individuals and companies we have manifested a way for the average person to potentially make a few extra bucks on what they already own and at the same time ease the process of finding unique props that will make the big difference for movies and series.
